## OAuth Tunnel in Development

In order to redirect OAuth requests securely to localhost, you'll need to setup a tunnel to redirect from the internet to localhost.

To do that, you can [install the `cloudflared` CLI tool](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/), and run:

```shell
# Note that you can also use a different port
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

You will need to keep this window running to maintain the tunnel during development.

For more advanced tunnel setup check out article [Setting up Cloudflare Tunnel for development](https://kirillplatonov.com/posts/setting-up-cloudflare-tunnel-for-development/).

## Quick start

To run this sample locally, you can clone this repository and do the following.

1. Create a new app in your Shopify Partner account unless you already have one.

2. Connect to Shopify:

```shell
shopify app connect
```

It will generate `.env` file with Shopify API credentials.

3. Add `HOST` with your cloudflare tunnel to `.env` file:

```
HOST=https://<Your tunnel host>
```

4. Update your app URLs in the Shopify Partner dashboard to point to your tunnel.

Set the `App URL` to `https://<your tunnel host>/` and the `Allowed redirection URL(s)` to `https://<your tunnel host>/auth/shopify/callback`.

5. Setup Rails app:

```shell
bin/setup
```

6. Start the app:

```shell
bin/dev
```

7. Install and open this app on a development shop.

## Billing

This sample uses simple billing configuration provided by `shopify_app` gem. You can configure it in `config/initializers/shopify_app.rb` using `config.billing` setting.

## Heroku Setup

To run your app in Heroku you need add the Shopify API Key, Shopify API Secret and Host to your config vars. You find the API Key and API Secret in your app setup. The host is your heroku app domain.

This templates config vars are:
`SHOPIFY_API_KEY`, `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`, `HOST`
